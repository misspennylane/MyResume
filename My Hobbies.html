    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my world of hobbies! Here's a glimpse into the things I love to
      do in my free time.

    <h2>Horse Riding</h2>
    <p>
      Horse riding is not just a hobby; it's a passion that brings me immense
      joy and fulfillment. As a lease rider/caretaker, I have the privilege of
      riding a horse owned by a friend, and there's nothing quite like the bond
      between horse and rider. Whether it's a leisurely trail ride through the
      countryside or training to improve our condition in the arena, horse
      riding allows me to connect with nature and experience a sense of freedom
      like no other. I'm fortunate to be able to participate in various
      activities with the horse, including preparing for events like the Eperse
      Vierdaagse. In June, we will embark on four days of long tracks on the
      Veluwe, an experience I'm eagerly looking forward to.I not only love to
      ride, but also enjoy caring for horses, groundwork, and simply being
      around them.<br/>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite pastimes is getting lost in the pages of a good book,
      especially in the enchanting world of fantasy. From epic adventures to
      magical realms, fantasy books ignite my imagination and transport me to
      places beyond the confines of reality. Curling up with a book and
      immersing myself in a captivating story is pure bliss for me. I enjoy
      sharing my love for books with others and often engage in discussions
      about them on social media platforms. Some of my favorite fantasy books
      include "The Lord of the Rings" series by J.R.R. Tolkien, "Harry Potter"
      series by J.K. Rowling, and the "Throne of Glass" series by Sarah J. Maas.

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not exploring imaginary worlds through books, you'll often find
      me diving into virtual realms through gaming. I have a soft spot for
      simulation games like The Sims, where I can unleash my creativity and
      build dream homes, design characters, and live out endless possibilities.
      Additionally, I enjoy exploring breathtaking landscapes and engaging in
      thrilling battles in games like Horizon Zero Dawn. I also find myself
      drawn to immersive RPGs like The Witcher and eagerly anticipate the
      release of games like Hogwarts Legacy, where I can embark on epic
      adventures and immerse myself in rich, fantastical worlds.

    <h2>Long walks</h2>
    <p>
      There's nothing quite like the simple pleasure of taking long walks,
      especially when accompanied by my dachshund Polly. Living on the Veluwe,
      where the forest is exceptionally beautiful, enhances the experience.
      Whether it's strolling through scenic parks or wandering along peaceful
      trails amidst the captivating landscape, these walks allow me to unwind,
      clear my mind, and fully immerse myself in the beauty of nature. Plus,
      spending quality time with my furry companion makes every walk even more
      special. <br/>
